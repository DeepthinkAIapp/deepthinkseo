                <strong>Hook:</strong> "I had a client who was convinced their local SEO wasn't working. 
                They had a beautiful website, great content, and even some backlinks. But when I checked 
                their citations, I found their business name was spelled differently on 15 different 
                directories. That inconsistency was killing their local rankings."
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                You know what's crazy? I've seen businesses spend thousands on fancy websites and expensive 
                SEO services, but they completely ignore the basics. Citations might seem boring compared 
                to content marketing or social media, but they're the foundation of local SEO success.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Think of citations as digital business cards scattered across the internet. When Google 
                sees your business information consistently listed in the same way across multiple directories, 
                it builds trust and confidence in your business's legitimacy. It's like having multiple 
                people vouch for you at a networking event.

              What Are Citations and Why Do They Matter?
            </h2>

              <p>
                A citation is simply a mention of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) on 
                another website. It doesn't have to include a link back to your site - just the mention 
                of your business information is enough to count as a citation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I've seen this play out time and time again. A local restaurant client of mine was struggling 
                to rank for "best pizza near me" despite having great reviews and a solid website. When I 
                audited their citations, I found they were listed as "Tony's Pizza" on some directories, 
                "Tony's Pizzeria" on others, and "Tony's Italian Restaurant" on a few more.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                After we standardized their NAP across all directories, their local rankings improved by 
                40% in just two months. Google finally understood that all these different listings were 
                referring to the same business, and their local pack visibility skyrocketed.

              The NAP Consistency Challenge
            </h2>

            <div style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#333', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
              <p>
                <strong>Name, Address, Phone - It Sounds Simple, Right?</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Wrong. I've audited hundreds of local businesses, and I've never found one with perfect 
                NAP consistency across all directories. There's always something - a missing suite number, 
                a different phone number format, or a slight variation in the business name.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The problem is that these inconsistencies confuse Google's algorithms. When Google sees 
                "123 Main St" in one directory and "123 Main Street" in another, it's not sure if these 
                are the same business. This uncertainty hurts your local rankings.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I always start by creating a master NAP document for my clients. This includes the exact 
                business name, complete address with proper formatting, and phone number in the standard 
                format. Then I use this as the reference for all citation building efforts.

                <strong>Tier 1: The Big Three</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Google My Business, Bing Places, and Apple Maps are the most important directories. 
                These are the ones that directly impact your local search visibility, so they need 
                to be perfect. I always start here and make sure everything is 100% accurate and complete.

            <div style={{ fontSize: '1.1rem', lineHeight: '1.8', color: '#333', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
              <p>
                <strong>Tier 2: Industry-Specific Directories</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                These are directories specific to your industry. For restaurants, it might be Yelp, 
                TripAdvisor, and OpenTable. For healthcare, it could be Healthgrades, Vitals, and 
                WebMD. These carry more weight than general directories because they're more relevant 
                to your business type.
              </p>
            </div>

                <strong>Tier 3: General Business Directories</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                These include Yellow Pages, Better Business Bureau, and other general business listings. 
                While they don't carry as much weight individually, they contribute to your overall 
                citation profile and help establish your business's online presence.

              The Citation Building Process That Actually Works

                <strong>Step 1: Audit Your Existing Citations</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I use tools like BrightLocal or Whitespark to find all existing citations for a business. 
                This shows me what's already out there and helps identify inconsistencies that need to be fixed.

                <strong>Step 2: Create a Citation Building Plan</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I prioritize directories based on their authority and relevance to the business. I also 
                consider the local market - some directories are more important in certain cities or 
                industries than others.

                <strong>Step 3: Build Citations Systematically</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't try to build all citations at once. Instead, I work through them systematically, 
                ensuring each one is complete and accurate before moving to the next. Quality over 
                quantity every time.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Citations might not be the sexiest part of local SEO, but 
                they're absolutely essential for success. When you build consistent, accurate citations 
                across relevant directories, you're telling Google that your business is legitimate, 
                established, and worthy of ranking in local search results.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The key is consistency. Every citation should have the exact same business name, address, 
                and phone number. It's tedious work, but it pays off in improved local rankings and 
                increased visibility for your business.
